Repository for advanced data journalism class

Hello!
I'm Amanda. I'm a senior and my emphasis area is data journalism. I plan to graduate in the spring (fingers crossed). In the classes I've had to take for my emphasis in data I've learned beginner html, css, sql and other software, languages and useful data tools but honestly I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. Once I began taking classes that were more technology based I realized how much I liked coding and using programs and numbers to help me tell stories. I'm really excited about this class because I hope to learn a lot in general but I also hope to figure out how to continue growing my skillset after graduation.
